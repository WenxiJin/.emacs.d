;; By default, Semantic automatically includes some default system include paths such as /usr/include, /usr/local/includeâ€¦ You can view the list of include paths in semantic-dependency-system-include-path. To add more include paths, for example Boost include paths, use the function semantic-add-system-include like this:
;; (semantic-add-system-include "/usr/include/boost" 'c++-mode)  ;; only for c++-mode
;; (semantic-add-system-include "~/linux/kernel")  ;; for c/c++-modes
;; (semantic-add-system-include "~/linux/include")
;; One nice thing of company-semantic is that it fixed an issue of original Semantic completion semantic-ia-complete-symbol: it can show you completions even if there's no prefix. The original semantic-ia-complete-symbol requires to have at least one character as a prefix for finding completions.
